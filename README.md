# ICS4U Modules

Your job is to create a binary library that does three things (with three functions).
1. Takes in a string as input and returns a binary string as output. Call this function ```text2bin()```
2. Takes a binary string as input and returns an ascii string as output. Call this function ```bin2text()```
3. Convert any letter to binary. Call this function ```chr2bin()```

Use the "name guard" to test the functions in the library to see if they work correctly.

Then in your main.py, recreate the OutputBinary assignment where you read the input from a textfile and output the binary to another bin file, but this time using your new library!
